Introduction

For the AI Magazine article Ñ I think we focus a chunk on what is syn bio and what are the problems that need solving. Maybe specific examples of AI in action in helping address these problems.  I think here we want to highlight some of the hard problems where AI has helped and how we want the AI community to be more involved? Here I think we want to pitch it as a domain with lots of ways for AI people to get involved. 

I like this, I wonder if it's a summary of our discussion session tipped on the challenges that syn bio brings. We had like 6-ish listed if i recall.
